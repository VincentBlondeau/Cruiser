# Cruiser

Cruiser is a tool to package Pharo applications.
The idea is to quickly convert a application in a development environment to a production one.
A production environment means:
- No writing on the disk
- No access to the source code (by the shortcuts, debugger,...)
- No error displaying on the interface
- The only thing accessible is the developed application 

# How to install

On a latest Pharo 7 image, clone the repository in Iceberg and load the baseline of Cruiser.
Or you can download the builded image on the CI (Work in progress)

# How to use it

The application packaging is highly customizable.
